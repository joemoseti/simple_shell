======Tasks 7 - 9======
Added:		- strtok2 (in strtok2.c): custom string tokenizer
		- builtin cd2 (in chdir.c): changes the shell's pwd, handling
		no argument, and argument '-'.
Replaced:	the use of the standard's strtok() with strtok2()
Modified:	strtok2.c: replaced first FOR loop's condition (*ptc) with 1
Fixed:		- strtok2: a bug where delimeter characters before first
		non-delimeter caused the untimely return of NULL.
		- cd2: a situation where the first call to setenv(), when
		argument to cd is -, caused the value of OLDPWD to be replaced
		with PWD just before the second call, thus preventing PWD from
		being properly updated in the environment.

========================Task 11===========================
Modified:	the structure of the shell driver. After getting user input,
		control is passed to a new subroutine, parser_launcher(), that
		handles input parsing, and execution of commands, even
		multiple user commands (in a command-line script).

Added:		- parser_launcher: handles parsing and execution of commands.
		- mult_cmd_launcher (in parser_launcher.c): launches multiple
		user commands in one shell loop.
		- char_srch: searches for a character in a string.

=======================Task 12============================
Added:		- a _struct shell_ type defined in main.h. Has one field for an
		int named _exstat_ to store the exit status of the last-run
		program.

Modified:	- parser_launcher: added functionality that enables the
		handling of the logical operators && and ||.
		- char_srch: added functionality to search for the presence of
		the logical operators.
		- launch_other: now collects and stores the executed program's
		exit status in shell.exstat

=======================Task 13============================
Added:		1. alias2: manages the process' alias environment.
		2. upd_alias_val: sets alias for requests of the form
		'name=value'.
		3. upd_alias_noval: sets alias for requests of the form 'name='
		4. print_alias: prints alias(es) of specified name(s).
